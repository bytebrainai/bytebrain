Ref provides us a way to functionally manage in-memory state. All operations on Ref are atomic and thread-safe, giving us a reliable foundation for synchronizing concurrent programs.

Ref:

  - is purely functional and referentially transparent
  - is concurrent-safe and lock-free
  - updates and modifies atomically

Operations

Though Ref has many operations, here we will introduce the most common and important ones.

make

```scala
def make[A](a: A): UIO[Ref[A]]
```
